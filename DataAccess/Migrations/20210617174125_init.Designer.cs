The amount of minerals\r\n                   contained in water are expressed in degrees of hardness. The so-called the German scale has 30\r\n                   degrees. The softest is distilled water, followed by rainwater. Surface water from\r\n                   streams, rivers and ponds are harder, and well water is often very hard. Water\r\n                   for watering cacti do not deer be harder than 4 degrees of German scale. Hardness\r\n                   waters usually form lime salts - carbonates.Frequent watering with salt\r\n                   they accumulate in the substrate and make it alkaline. If the pH value of the substance\r\n                   increase to 8 - cacti stop growing. Therefore, rainwater is considered the best for watering cacti. However.and it can be unclean, especially in larger ones\r\n                   cities.Ideally, rainwater would be filtered through filtered filters\r\n                   activated carbon.This would remove dissolved hydrogen sulfide, sulfur\r\n                   oxide, various tar substances and coarser ash particles.Most florists are,\r\n                   however, directed to tap water - hence hard water.Hardness\r\n                   can be significantly reduced by cooking.If peat is used, then it is\r\n                   the negative effect of hard water is much less.
